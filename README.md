hdWGCNA is an R package for performing weighted gene co-expression network analysis [(WGCNA)](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-559) in high dimensional transcriptomics data such as single-cell RNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics. hdWGCNA is highly modular and can construct context-specific co-expression networks across cellular and spatial hierarchies. hdWGNCA identifies modules of highly co-expressed genes and provides context for these modules via statistical testing and biological knowledge sources. hdWGCNA uses datasets formatted as [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html) objects. Check out the [hdWGCNA in single-cell data tutorial](https://smorabit.github.io/hdWGCNA/articles/basic_tutorial.html) or the [hdWGCNA in spatial transcriptomics data tutorial](https://smorabit.github.io/hdWGCNA/articles/ST_basics.html) to get started.

**New functionality** hdWGCNA is now able to perform [Transcription Factor Regulatory Network Analysis](https://smorabit.github.io/hdWGCNA/articles/tf_network.htm). This functionality was introduced in our publication [Childs & Morabito et al., Cell Reports (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124724002845).

If you use hdWGCNA in your research, please cite the following papers in addition to the [original WGCNA publication](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-559):

* [Morabito et al., Cell Reports Methods (2023)](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(23)00127-3)

## Installation

We recommend creating an R [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment for hdWGCNA.

```bash
# create new conda environment for R
conda create -n hdWGCNA -c conda-forge r-base r-essentials

# activate conda environment
conda activate hdWGCNA
```

Next open R and install the required dependencies:

* [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), an R-based software ecosystem for bioinformatics and biostatistics.
* [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/), a package for package development in R.
* [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html), a general-purpose toolkit for single-cell data science.

```r
# install BiocManager
install.packages("BiocManager")

# install Bioconductor core packages
BiocManager::install()

# install devtools
BiocManager::install("devtools")

# install latest version of Seurat from CRAN
install.packages("Seurat")

# alternatively, install Seurat v4
install.packages("Seurat", repos = c("https://satijalab.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org"))

```

Now you can install the hdWGCNA package using `devtools`.

```r
devtools::install_github('smorabit/hdWGCNA', ref='dev')
```
