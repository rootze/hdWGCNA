\arguments{
\item{seurat_obj}{A Seurat object}

\item{fraction}{A numeric that determines the minimum cells that a gene must be expressed in order to be included. For example, fraction = 0.05 means that 5\% of cells must express a gene (count > 0) for it to be included.}

\item{gene_list}{A character string of gene names, only used if type = "custom"}

\item{assay}{Assay in seurat_obj to compute module eigengenes. Default is DefaultAssay(seurat_obj)}

\item{wgcna_name}{name of the WGCNA experiment}

\item{type}{How to select genes? Select "variable", "fraction", "all", or "custom".}

\description{
Select genes that will be used for co-expression network analysis
}
\details{
SelectNetworkGenes allows us to specify the genes that will be used for co-expression network analysis.
This function is called by SetupForWGCNA. By default, the variable features in VariableFeatures(seurat_obj) are used.
A custom gene list can also be used with the gene_list parameter and setting gene_select="custom".

We can also identify genes that are expressed above 0 in a certain proportion of the dataset by settting gene_select='fraction'.
For example, by setting fraction=0.1 and group.by='seurat_clusters', this function will identify the set of genes
that are expressed in 10\% of cells in at least one of the clusters.
